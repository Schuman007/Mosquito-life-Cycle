# Mosquito-life-Cycle
The main goal of this project is to understand the impact of the spray on mosquito population.
Mosquito life-cycle is governed by weather data like temperature, rainfall.
In this project, we explicitly model the life-cycle of mosquito and try to understand the impact
of regula spary in the summer vs to spray when the number of blood seeking mosquitoes are higher than 
some user defined threshold.
